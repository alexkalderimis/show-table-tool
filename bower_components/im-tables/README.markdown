InterMine Results Tables
=========================

The data display library for InterMine web-applications.

This library provides a highly functional data exploration and
download tool suitable for embedding into any website. It requires
an InterMine data-warehouse to communicate with for data, and a
modern web-browser for efficient display.

This set of user interface tools would not be possible without the
fantastic set of open source web development tools available today.
We are extremely grateful to benefit from the hard work put into the
development of:

 * CoffeeScript
 * jQuery
 * Backbone
 * Bootstrap
 * underscore
 * FontAwesome
 * d3

This library is also open source, being freely available under the
LGPL licence.
